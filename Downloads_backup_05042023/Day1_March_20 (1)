What is a Framework ?
-----------------------------------
 Framework is a special kind of Software which provides some common logics which are required for application development in less time.

 Common Logic - JDBC
 		Creating Database connection
 		driver manager
 		create statement
 		execute statement
 		Result query

Frameworks are divided into 3 types
-----------------------------------
ORM frameworks are used to develop Persistence layer in applications.
	Hibernate, Ibatis

Using Web frameworks We can just develop web applications
	Structs, JSF, Wicket

Using Spring, we can develop all kinds of applications like Business Logic, Persistance Logic & Web Logic
Spring

Introduction to spring
-------------------------
Spring is a alternative framework for EJB Technology.
Spring is a application development framework
Using Spring we can develop all types of applications ( end to end)
Spring framework is light weight and open source framework for building java applications.
Open Source means it is not only free s/w but its source code will be exposed to programmers along with installation.
The main feature of Spring is Dependency Injection & IOC Container.
Spring is non-invasive framework.
If we use SF to develop project, we need to manage all the configurations required for that project.
Spring Modules are loosely coupled.

Why Spring is light weight ?
----------------------------
If java class is acting as resource of certain technology based software application is 
not extending, implementing predefined classes of Spring API then it is called POJO class.


Using Spring, How many types of applications we can develop ?
	Standalone applications
	Web Applications
	Distributed Applications

What is a Web Applicatoin ?
----------------------------
A web application is a software or program which is accessible using any web browser 
Its frontend is usually created using languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, which are supported by major browsers.
Web applications are meant for C 2 B (Customer to Business)
End users will interact with web applications directly
		Gmail
		Flipkart
		Amazon

Distributed Applications
----------------------------
A distributed application is software that is executed or run on multiple computers
The application which is interacting with another application is called as Distributed application
To develop distributed applications we will use Webservices
Using Spring MVC we can develop and access REST APIs
Distributed applications are meant for B 2 B
		Passport ----> Aadhar app
		Zomato -----> Banking apps
		MakeMyTrip ---> Airlines apps

Why Spring is loosely coupled software ?
-----------------------------------------
While working with Spring we can use either individual modules or multiple modules together.
We can integrate spring with other java technologies in application development like Servlet, JSP, Hibernate, Structs etc.


Spring Modules 
-------------------
Spring can be used for the development of particular layer of a real time application unlike struts and hibernate, but with spring we can develop all layers.
Spring 1.x contains 7 Modules
Spring 2.x contains 6 Modules
Spring 3.x contains 20 Modules but they are grouped into 6 major categories

Spring Modules
-------------------
Spring core is the base module for all other modules
Spring DAO/Spring JDBC module provides abstraction layer on plain JDBC to develop persistence logic.
Spring ORM Module provides abstraction layer on other ORM flows like Hibernate & Ibatis
Spring AOP module is given to apply aspects on Spring Applications
Spring Web Module is given to make spring application communication from other web framework software applications like Structs, JSF e.t.c
Spring Web-MVC is given spring own web framework develop MVC Architecture based web applications.
Spring Context/JEE Module provides abstraction layer on multiple core technologies like EJB, RMS, JMS, Java Mail to develop Distributed applications & other applications.

Why Spring Boot ? 
----------------------

Spring Boot is an open-source java based framework maintained by a company called Pivotal. 
Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring framework, with minimal or less configurations.
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". 
Spring Boot provides production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration. 
Spring Boot can be used to develop Spring based applications either by using JAVA or Kotlin or Groovy 
Spring Boot reduces application development time. 
Spring Boot will improve Productivity. 
SpringBoot provided auto-configuration mechanism to simplify programmers life.

Spring Versions 
--------------------

Why SpringBoot
--------------------
	Develop Spring Application Faster
	Avoid Boiler Plate Code
	Convention Over Configuration
	Embedded Tomcat
	Actuators

Preferred Languages
-------------------
	Java
	Kotlin
	Groovy

Build Management tool
---------------------
	maven
	Gradle

Advantages of Spring Boot
-------------------------
1) Spring Boot Starters : To Simplify Maven Configuration
						spring-boot-starter-parent
						spring-boot-starter-web
						spring-boot-starter-webflux
						spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
						spring-boot-starter-mail
						spring-boot-validation
						Spring-boot-devtools

2) Autoconfiguration
3) Embedded Servers
4) Embedded Databases
5) Actuators
6) No Version Conflicts

1) How to create spring boot Application ?
---------------------------------------
To create Spring Boot Applications, Spring People provided Spring Initializer
		https://start.spring.io
Application will be downloaded in the form zip then we will extract that zip and we will import into IDE. 
Using Spring Tool Suite ( STS )
